I accidentally opened my "expired" folder in Marginote and I just cannot believe how far I have gone from linear algebra. All of these came from these little day to day work. I learned how to calculate Determinant  today. I learned Gaussian map in local coordinates today (I have absolutely no idea what it is now).

I wonder what these little gains I made would look like when they are prensented in front of me at once. Therefore I decided to make this App that records my daily learning so that one day I can see how far I have gone.
